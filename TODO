Improve image view performance, fim is slow with 12MP photos

fim is not autozooming properly on portrait images

Front index page:
    Local media (to /media)
    Youtube (see omxyt)
    iPlayer (needs investigation)

Consider writing omximdb into a separate project to run on webserver so that if imdb changes only have to change my service
Similar service for searching youtube, iplayer and returning video urls maybe for the same reason?

pimc is the client, pimcservice the service, both can be open source
