    0. Install omxplayer on your raspberry pi and optionally fim for 
       framebuffer image display (browsing and showing images)
       apt-get install omxplayer fim

    1. Install pexpect and webpy on your raspberry pi
       apt-get install python-pexpect python-webpy

    2. Unpack the tarball to a suitable location, eg: /home/pi/pimc 
    
    3. Edit the video folder in the MEDIA_ROOT string at the top of config.py

    4. Start pimc with:

        python code.py 55555

    5. Connect to your raspberry pi on port 55555 with any smartphone/web 
       browser. Browse your movies, images and mp3s and play them.

    6. IMDB support:

       6.1 Uses the filename to construct a search. Takes everything up to the
           first fullstop/period and converts underscores to spaces. You will
           have much better success with filenames like transformers_2.avi and
           jingle_all_the_way.mp4

       6.2 If a /tv/ folder is found somewhere in the current path, IMDB
           lookups will not be done.

       6.3 A file called imdb_cache.txt contains all film info looked up with
           IMDB so after the first lookup, access is quick.
